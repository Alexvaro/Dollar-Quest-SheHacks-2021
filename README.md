# Dollar-Quest-SheHacks-2021
Dollar Quest is a game my team and I designed during SheHacks, an all-female hackathon run by Western University.
We took on the challenge to create a project that educated girls 10-15 on banking and finance and from it came Dollar Quest - a mobile game that stimulates the 
experience of making important financial decisions to set yourself up for success. We designed the UX/UI layout through Figma and created associations that connect
specific buttons and components to naviagte users to the corresponding pages. Through this project, I was able to increase my knowledge in game design as well
as gain experience creating and managing projects on a team. I hope you enjoy taking a look at Dollar Quest!
